            <h2>About Me ⇝ </h2>
            <p> Hello,I'm R.Raja harsha currently pursuing Final year Btech in 'ST.PETERS ENGINEERING COLLEGE'  in the stream of 'CSE (AI & ML)'.</p>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate and creative web developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies. My journey in the world of web development began with a curiosity-driven desire to build things that make a difference. I love turning ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites and applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I've gained experience in a variety of web development tools and languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I thrive on staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies to deliver modern and efficient solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical skills, I'm a strong believer in collaboration and teamwork. I enjoy working with diverse teams to tackle complex problems and deliver exceptional results. My goal is to create web experiences that not only meet but exceed user expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or diving into a good book. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and explore new opportunities in the ever-evolving field of web development.
